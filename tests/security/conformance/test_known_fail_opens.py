"""The known fail-opens, wired into the GOC-62 conformance suite (D3(b)).

CONCEPT:AU-OS.identity.stack-wide-auth-conformance

This file does NOT re-implement the behavioral proofs — duplicating them here
would be exactly the "second, independently-maintained copy of the same
decision" pattern this standard's §5 (nav-vs-backend drift) warns against.
Instead it asserts the conformance manifest and the real, executed proofs
agree:

1. **BUG-036 (AU federation reader) — FIXED.** Proof:
   `tests/unit/knowledge_graph/test_federation_carrier_authority.py`. Was RED
   (`DID NOT RAISE SessionRequiredError`) until `engine_federation.py` gained
   an explicit `resolve_session(required_scope="kg:read")` guard (matching the
   cypher/sql/sparql dialects) AND `ActorContextMiddleware` (the structural
   root cause -- an unconditional no-op with no token) gained a
   `require_verified_session` mode wired on for graph-os specifically
   (`mcp/middlewares.py`, `mcp/server_factory.py`). The manifest disposition
   is now `AUTHENTICATED_REQUIRED`, not `KNOWN_FAIL_OPEN` -- this test asserts
   that (not the reverse) so a REGRESSION (someone reverting the fix without
   reverting the manifest) is caught the same way a stale-manifest drift
   would have been caught before: a disposition that no longer matches the
   real, executed proof's behavior.

2. **BUG-037 (EG observability ingest)** — proof is new in this pass:
   `epistemic-graph/src/server/obs/mod.rs`'s
   `tests::bug_037_obs_ingest_post_bypasses_the_deny_gate`, committed on the
   `goc/goc-62-keycloak-auth-standard` branch in the `epistemic-graph`
   worktree (a Rust test — this Python suite cannot execute it directly, but
   asserts its existence in source so an accidental deletion is caught). Still
   open (owned by `OWNER-EG-OBS`, a different repository); unaffected by the
   BUG-036 fix above.

GRAPHOS-HOST-R008 NOTE: this file's proof citations (``tests/unit/...``) name
paths inside the agent-utilities REPOSITORY, not graph-os's own. This module
moved here with the surface it audits (``mcp/tools/query_tools.py``'s
dispatcher), but AU's ``tests/`` tree is dev-checkout content, never shipped
in an installed distribution -- so the checks below resolve AU's repo root
best-effort (an editable-install convention this homelab's graph-os
deployment already relies on) and SKIP, rather than fail, when it is not
found; this is the SAME pattern this file already used for the
epistemic-graph/agent-webui sibling-repo checks, now extended to AU itself.
