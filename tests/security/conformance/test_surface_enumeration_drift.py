"""Drift test for the GOC-62 conformance suite's enumeration mechanism (D2/D3(b)).

CONCEPT:AU-OS.identity.stack-wide-auth-conformance

This is the test that makes "a new surface is covered by default" real rather
than aspirational: it re-derives the live set of `graph_query` dialects by
parsing the ACTUAL source (never a hand-maintained list) and asserts every one
has a reviewed disposition in `surface_manifest.py`. A dialect added later with
no manifest entry makes THIS test fail — the surface is never silently
uncovered.
