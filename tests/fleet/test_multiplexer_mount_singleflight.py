"""Regression tests for D-CDX-44: concurrent first loads of the SAME
not-yet-mounted MCP child must not start duplicate child runtimes or race
catalog/tool/forwarder registration.

Before the fix, ``MCPMultiplexer.mount_child`` had no per-server
singleflight/lock around the "is this server already mounted?" check: two
concurrent callers for the same unmounted ``server_name`` could both observe
``server_name not in self.children``, each call ``_start_child`` (a real
provider process/connection), and race ``_register_child_result``. These
tests deterministically interleave two concurrent ``mount_child`` calls
(via an artificial await inside a faked ``_start_child``) to prove exactly
one child start, one registration, no leaked singleflight state, and that a
failed leader does not poison a later retry.
