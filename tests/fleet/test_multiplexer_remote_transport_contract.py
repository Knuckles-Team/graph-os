"""The multiplexer speaks MCP SDK v2's remote-transport contract.

CONCEPT:AU-ECO.mcp.protocol-compat-bridge

Regression guard for the fastmcp-4 default. SDK v2 renamed
``streamablehttp_client`` -> ``streamable_http_client`` AND replaced its
``headers`` / ``auth`` / ``httpx_client_factory`` keywords with a single
pre-configured ``http_client=``. Before this guard existed the multiplexer
still imported the v1 name behind a ``try/except ImportError`` that bound it to
``None``, so every remote child raised ``RuntimeError: mcp SDK has no
streamablehttp_client`` — and since ``deploy/mcp-fleet.registry.yml`` defaults
every fleet service to ``transport: streamable-http``, that is the entire
deployed fleet.

The pre-existing coverage for this path lives in ``tests/test_multiplexer_transports.py``,
which ``pytest.ini``'s ``testpaths`` (``tests/unit tests/integration
tests/retrieval``) does not collect — it is dead coverage and caught none of
this. These live in ``tests/unit`` on purpose.
