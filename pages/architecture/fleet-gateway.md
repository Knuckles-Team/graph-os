# GraphOS Embedded Fleet Gateway

GraphOS owns progressive discovery and invocation of the configured MCP
connector fleet. The internal multiplexer implementation is a library component
of the GraphOS process, not a separately launched console command, container, or
network service.

## Runtime shape

<div class="admonition architecture" markdown>
<p class="admonition-title">Runtime shape</p>

An MCP client talks only to GraphOS, which exposes `find_tools`/
`list_catalog`, `load_tools`/`unload_tools`, and `catalog_refresh`/
`catalog_dispatch`. The loader, the refresh path, and KG toolkit ingestion
all reach the fleet of `*-mcp` connectors through one canonical child
client boundary. `catalog_refresh` also drives a canonical fleet
source-sync writer that projects into the Knowledge Graph.

At startup GraphOS exposes its focused graph tools and a bounded fleet catalog.
A caller discovers a capability, loads only its selected child tools, invokes
them through GraphOS, and may unload them to reclaim context. The catalog uses
deterministic collision-free prefixes and never recursively registers GraphOS
as its own child.

## Isolation and resilience

Each child runtime enforces its configured concurrency bound, queue timeout,
connection pool, call timeout, restart budget, and circuit breaker. A child
failure is isolated and returned as a typed error; it cannot block GraphOS
startup or remove unrelated capabilities. Child transports may be stdio,
streamable HTTP, or SSE as declared by AgentConfig.

When a recovered child reconnects, its required handshake `tools/list` is also
used to compare the newly advertised forwarding catalog with the bounded digest
already exposed by GraphOS. A changed schema replaces only the affected
FastMCP forwarders before the recovered generation accepts calls, invalidates
that child's derived discovery/embedding caches, and queues
`notifications/tools/list_changed` for each session that had the old forwarder
loaded. Recovery is a detached supervisor task, so the notification is sent
only on each affected session's next real request rather than reusing a stale
response stream. FastMCP 4 registers duplicate replacements one at a time, so
the multiplexer stages the complete executable component registry and restores
the exact prior SDK components with one registry swap if any native registration
fails. A persistent failure therefore retains the prior live tool and routing
state while failing only that child closed with a stable health category. An
equivalent reconnect does not probe the provider again or churn host
registrations. A hot catalog reload removes mux-owned forwarders and per-session
eager-load results before mounting the revised catalog, so same-named tools
cannot retain obsolete schemas.

An administrator refreshes the complete authorization-scoped catalog through
`catalog_refresh` or its exact REST twin, `POST /api/mcp/catalog/refresh`.
The request carries the expected configuration revision, catalog generation,
and snapshot digest. GraphOS obtains tools, prompts, resources, and resource
templates from each child under one deadline, validates the complete candidate,
synchronously acknowledges the existing source-sync projection, checks the
replica cohort, and only then publishes one immutable generation. Any missing
family, failed projection, deadline, stale expectation, or divergent replica
rejects the candidate without partial publication.

`catalog_dispatch` resolves a tool against that exact generation and digest.
If a read-only tool that was present in the snapshot reaches GraphOS but its
child answers `Unknown tool`, GraphOS may relist the same child generation once,
verify the descriptor still exists, and retry once. This does not repair a
client-side advertised-name miss that never reaches GraphOS; the client/service
bridge remains responsible for refreshing its own advertised catalog.

The anti-sprawl boundary is explicit: `McpCatalogReconciler` is the sole
transport-neutral snapshot/generation/high-watermark authority;
`MCPMultiplexer` is the sole child-session and FastMCP I/O adapter; source-sync
is a downstream projection; and REST/WebUI bind to the actually served
multiplexer. They never construct a detached catalog or child pool.

KG live metadata discovery does not construct a second MCP client. It calls the
same bounded one-shot probe used by the fleet gateway. Consequently every
transport resolves named TLS references through AgentConfig, denies redirects,
pins DNS and peer identity, applies the exact private-host policy, and fails
closed when configured authentication cannot be materialized. Stdio children
receive only the minimal runtime allowlist plus their explicitly delegated
configuration; unrelated parent credentials never cross the process boundary.
Runtime-materialized credentials are authenticated with a process-ephemeral
attestation over the complete child declaration: executable and arguments,
transport destination, TLS and private-host policy, time bounds, headers and
environment, and parent-only controls. Mutation after materialization therefore
invalidates both child secret use and Langfuse parent-mediated graph ingestion.

Provider tools use one explicit client-execution boundary. Asynchronous SDK
methods are awaited directly; synchronous SDK methods are moved to an AnyIO
worker thread. The strict synchronous helper rejects async callables instead of
returning an unexecuted coroutine. This keeps the GraphOS event loop responsive
and prevents action handlers from silently dropping asynchronous provider work.

The probe bounds initialization and total discovery time, tool count, aggregate
catalog bytes, nesting depth, and collection size. Errors expose only stable
categories. A failed connection is distinct from an authoritative empty tool
catalog, so ingestion never fabricates tools from configuration flags after an
authentication, trust, or transport failure.

The same bounded probe also enumerates a child's Skills-over-MCP `skill://`
Resources alongside its Tools (best-effort — a server without resource-listing
support degrades to no skills, never a failed tool probe), so `find_tools`
ranks skills and tools in one result set. See
[Skills-over-MCP](https://knuckles-team.github.io/agent-utilities/architecture/skills_over_mcp/)
for the full unified-capability design.

Interactive discovery uses one shared wall-clock budget for catalog probes and
semantic reranking. When the request names a configured domain such as GitHub or
Mattermost, GraphOS probes that matching server first through the same canonical
boundary, then spends the remaining budget on broad fleet fan-out. A large set of
slow unrelated children therefore cannot hide the named server behind a catalog
budget timeout.

## Configuration

GraphOS reads one AgentConfig-backed `mcp_config.json`. Child entries may
declare enable/disable filters and bounded resilience overrides. Secrets,
endpoints, and authentication material remain external configuration and are
never copied into documentation, traces, or graph records.

Persistent catalogs express child credential slots as neutral uppercase
aliases such as `env://CHILD_ACCESS_TOKEN`. A live environment or
runtime-secrets projection for that alias has precedence. When the direct alias
is absent, `AgentConfig.MCP_FLEET_SECRET_REFS` may map it to one validated
`env://`, `vault://`, or `secret://` reference. The mapping contains references
only, is resolved at the exact child boundary, and fails closed for malformed
or unavailable values. An `env://ALIAS` self-map selects that key from the
runtime-secrets source before execution. Resolved material is never written
back to the catalog or AgentConfig.

Freshness records contain a keyed opaque identity plus neutral metadata only.
The identity binds endpoint, command, arguments, TLS selection, and non-secret
configuration without retaining any of those values; resolved credential values
do not participate. Production uses the configured persistence identity key.
The zero-infrastructure development profile uses a process-ephemeral key and
therefore conservatively refreshes after restart.

The process-level deployment contract is therefore simple:

```bash
graph-os --transport stdio
graph-os --transport streamable-http --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8004
```

Clients connect only to GraphOS. The internal implementation lives in
`agent_utilities.mcp.multiplexer` and `agent_utilities.mcp.child_resilience`,
but neither module defines an independently deployed service contract.

## History: the favorable-restatement invariant (D-OB-3)

CONCEPT:AU-OS.governance.truthful-state-invariant.

A closed 2026 RCA (fleet-mount bookkeeping disagreeing with the callable
tool surface: `list_catalog`/`resolve_and_mount`/`_notify_tools_changed`
reporting a tool as `mounted: true` and callable when it was neither —
fixed and merged on `fix/mcp-tool-state-desync`) named a recurring bug
shape worth keeping as a standing check on this module:

> **The favorable-restatement anti-pattern.** A status field is *derived*
> by a second layer instead of *read through* from the one component that
> actually performed (or can verify) the operation. The restatement drifts
> toward "looks more done than it is" because the second layer encodes what
> the operation was *supposed* to mean, not what actually happened — and
> nothing forces the two to be re-checked against each other when either
> side changes.

**The invariant this restores:** reported state must be derived from the
authoritative source at the moment of reporting — never restated, cached,
or inferred by a second layer that only witnessed the operation's outcome
secondhand. Two tells that new code is about to violate it: (1) two names
for what reads like one concept (a process-level `mounted` vs. a
session-level `mounted`) that are free to disagree once a second field is
added; (2) a success value assigned from an input parameter or an early
branch, then never revisited even when a later fallible step fails.

At the time of the RCA, `_server_level_fallback()`
(`agent_utilities.mcp.multiplexer`, used by `find_tools`'s no-match branch)
still returned process-level `mounted: server in self.children` — the same
bug shape, in a separate code path not covered by that fix. Anyone
touching catalog/mount status reporting in this module should re-check
that path (and any new status field on the fleet gateway) against this
invariant before shipping. The full RCA text — including the other
confirmed instances of this bug class elsewhere in the codebase — is
preserved in agent-utilities' git history (`07dcbac23`), not carried
forward as a standalone page.
