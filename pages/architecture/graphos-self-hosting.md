# graph-os Self-Hosting Cutover — Design (EXECUTED 2026-07-26)

> **✅ EXECUTED 2026-07-26 against `platform/graph-os` + `platform/epistemic-graph`.**
> Result: one self-contained `graph-os` pod on `<ENGINE_NODE>` (engine native-sidecar + graph-os,
> `2/2 Ready`), engine loaded 87 graphs (matches pre-cutover baseline), graph-os connected
> `resolved_mode=remote endpoint_count=1 reachable_count=1 breaker=0 latency=0.4ms` over the
> in-pod unix socket, messaging up (mattermost+telegram). Old `epistemic-graph` Deployment
> kept scaled to 0 (not deleted) for the rollback/soak window. **One deviation from the spec
> below:** the sidecar binds `--tcp-addr 0.0.0.0:9100` (not `127.0.0.1:9100`) because a
> `tcpSocket` startupProbe dials the POD IP, not loopback — a loopback-only bind makes the
> probe "connection refused" forever. Same TLS+HMAC posture as the pre-cutover engine (which
> also bound 0.0.0.0), so no security regression. FOLLOW-UP to restore true loopback-only:
> switch the three probes to an `exec` python `socket.create_connection(('127.0.0.1',9100))`
> check, then revert the bind to `127.0.0.1`. Live manifest persisted to
> `services/graph-os/k8s/graph-os.deployment.yaml`.

## Why this is possible now, and why it wasn't before

`docker/graphos-unified.Dockerfile` (W-C) now bakes the engine binary
(`epistemic-graph-server`, at `/usr/local/bin/`) **into the same image** as
`graph-os`/`kg_server` — confirmed live: `platform/graph-os` already runs
`<REGISTRY>/graph-os-unified@sha256:…` today. Before this image existed, co-locating
engine + graph-os in one pod required two *different* container images (see
`services/epistemic-graph/k8s/bundled-core-pod.yaml` Variant A: an `ubuntu:26.04` engine
sidecar with a hostPath-mounted binary, alongside a separate `<REGISTRY>/agent-utilities`
graph-os container) — the genesis reference already names that shape "a valid stepping
stone toward the tighter PyO3 embedding, not a competing target." This document is that
stepping stone made concrete against the current unified image and the real 87-graph
production store, superseding the need for two images: **both containers below use the
SAME unified image**, differing only in `command`.

**Two mechanisms, only one designed here:**

- **(a) INTERIM (this document).** The engine runs as a second process **in the same
  pod** as graph-os, using the engine's OWN existing production config — a k8s **native
  sidecar** (`initContainers` entry with `restartPolicy: Always`, k8s ≥1.29; this cluster
  is 1.35), not a single shell script that backgrounds a process. graph-os **connects**
  to it over a local socket exactly as it connects to today's separate Deployment —
  nothing in `kg_server` changes.
- **(b) FINAL — W-A's in-process PyO3 engine.** `epistemic_graph.engine` embedded via
  PyO3 in the SAME process as `kg_server` (no second process, no socket at all). Per
  `reports/unified-binary-program.md`, this is **NOT STARTED** (the largest workstream).
  Nothing below depends on it landing; (a) is a complete, shippable end state on its own
  and is not "temporary scaffolding" for (b) — it removes the separate Deployment today,
  and (b) can replace *this pod's* sidecar with an in-process call later without another
  data migration (same store, same identity, only the transport inside the pod changes).

## The identity trap this design exists to avoid

**Do not** delete the separate `epistemic-graph` Deployment and simply let graph-os's
existing `EngineResolver` **autostart** a local engine against the same `--persist-dir`.
It will start, but it will not be able to serve the 87-graph store, and it will fail in
one of two ways depending on whether graph-os's own process already happens to carry an
`EPISTEMIC_GRAPH_SIGNER_KEYS_JSON` (it does not, today):

- Read `agent_utilities/knowledge_graph/core/graph_compute.py`
  (`_autostart_engine`, ~L1656–1711): when it spawns a child engine, it takes the
  **current request's own verified actor** (`bootstrap_session.engine_verified_context()`
  — a per-caller Keycloak identity, not a static service account) and either (i) if the
  parent process already carries an `EPISTEMIC_GRAPH_SIGNER_KEYS_JSON`, **requires that
  exact actor to already be a key in it** — `raise RuntimeError("verified process
  identity is absent from the engine signer registry")` if not — or (ii) if no registry
  is configured at all, **mints a brand-new throwaway signer key for just that one
  actor** and hands it to the fresh child.
- Neither case is what the 87-graph store's `rbac.redb` was actually provisioned with.
  Per `reports/HANDOFF-2026-07-22.md` §7, the store's RBAC was bootstrapped for
  `homelab-system` and graph-os's own service-account subject — a per-request end-user
  identity (case i) or a brand-new ad hoc one (case ii) matches neither, and the engine
  answers `ACCESS_DENIED: a provisioned identity/RBAC policy is required` (or, against a
  genuinely empty store, would instead treat it as a *fresh* bootstrap — also wrong,
  since this store is not fresh).
- **Autostart is designed for a zero-config local/tiny engine, not for attaching to an
  already-governed production store.** `resolve_engine`
  (`knowledge_graph/core/engine_resolver.py`) only takes the autostart leg when
  `GRAPH_SERVICE_ENDPOINTS` is **absent**. The fix is simply to never let that happen:
  **always set `GRAPH_SERVICE_ENDPOINTS` explicitly**, pointing at the sidecar engine.
  With it set, the resolver's precedence is `remote` — "every configured topology is a
  hard contract: connect to it, never auto-spawn a local stand-in" — the exact same code
  path graph-os already uses to reach today's separate engine, just now over a socket
  inside its own pod instead of TLS to a sibling pod. The sidecar engine is launched
  directly (its own binary, its own CLI flags, its own env) — **never** through
  `_autostart_engine`.

This is the whole of "sidesteps the autostart identity wall": not a workaround, but
*not exercising* the autostart code path at all, by construction.

## The redb single-writer-lock handoff

The engine enforces an OS-level single-writer lock on `--persist-dir`
(`src/main.rs`, `persist_lock::acquire`, held for the whole process lifetime; a second
engine pointed at the same directory refuses to start while the lock is held). There is
**no hot handoff** — the old engine must fully release the lock before the new one can
take it:

```
1. Freeze writes / note the current graph count for a post-cutover sanity check.
2. Snapshot the redb store (see "Pre-flight" below) — the ~2-3 min window in step 3
   is exactly the kind of change the workspace's own migration discipline requires
   rehearsing against a COPY first (proven practice: reports/HANDOFF-2026-07-22.md
   caught two production-breaking regressions this way before they hit the real
   9.9G store).
3. Scale platform/epistemic-graph to 0 (NOT delete — see Rollback).
     -> lock released. KG is now DOWN for every client (graph-os has no other engine).
4. Roll platform/graph-os to the new pod spec (below). The engine sidecar acquires
   the lock, loads the redb catalog (4 shards, ~45s-2min historically —
   startupProbe budgets to it), and the sidecar's startupProbe passes.
     -> kubelet was blocking graph-os's own container start until this passed;
        it now starts, connects (mode="remote", see above), and serves.
   Total KG-down window: stop (near-instant) + new-engine-load — the same ballpark
   as today's engine `Recreate` restarts (an eg cutover on 2026-07-22 measured
   ~2.5 min end-to-end for a comparable stop/reload).

   ⚠ **This estimate no longer holds at current store size (D-CDX-65, open).**
   A governed rollout on 2026-08-02 (main `3329180d`) measured the old pod
   terminated at `11:10:48Z`, the engine logging "Acquired the configured
   single-writer persistence lock" at `11:11:38Z`, then **no further progress
   for 5m26s** (only `redb: catalog-loaded 87 graph(s) from 4 shard(s) —
   lazy startup, no node/edge data read` at `11:17:04Z`) before the sidecar's
   startupProbe passed and serving containers started at `11:17:05-06Z` — a
   measured **~6m17s** end-to-end KG-down window against an ~11GB persist-dir
   (4 shards: 532MB/5.0GB/4.0GB/1.2GB), not the ~45s-2min this section
   originally scoped for. The startup budget (`failureThreshold: 200,
   periodSeconds: 3` = 600s) already accounts for this being slow, but gives
   operators and connecting clients no progress signal during the wait —
   only connection-refused. D-CDX-65 (open) owns instrumenting per-shard
   phase/bytes/records/duration so this is a visible, honest progress signal
   instead of a silent multi-minute gap, and profiling whether the "lazy,
   no node/edge data read" catalog load can be made to actually cost close
   to nothing, as its own log line claims it should.
5. Verify (checklist below), THEN delete the old epistemic-graph/Service, or leave
   them scaled to 0 for a rollback window before deleting.
```

**Out of scope / do not touch:** `platform/epistemic-kvcache` (image
`<REGISTRY>/epistemic-graph:kvcache`, runs on the cluster's GPU node) shares the
engine codebase but is an **unrelated** workload (vLLM KV-cache layering, not KG
storage) on a different node — this cutover does not affect it.

**Verify-before-cutover item (do not assume):** the live `epistemic-graph` container
declares `containerPort: 9130 name: kvcache` alongside `9100`, and
`graph-os-env`'s `EPISTEMIC_GRAPH_KVCACHE_URL=http://<ENGINE_NODE_IP>:9130` points at it — but
the container's actual CLI args (`kubectl get deploy epistemic-graph -o yaml`) show no
corresponding `--kvcache-addr`-style flag today. Confirm whether anything is really
listening on 9130 on the CURRENT engine before cutover (e.g. `kubectl exec` a connect
test against it, or check the engine's own startup log for a "kvcache" listener line —
both read-only). If something is, add the equivalent flag to the sidecar's `args` below;
if nothing is, the port declaration is vestigial and needs no equivalent.

## Pre-flight (mandatory — do not skip)

Mirrors the two techniques that already prevented outages in this exact system
(`reports/HANDOFF-2026-07-22.md` §"pre-flight techniques"):

1. **Copy the redb store** (`<ENGINE_HOST_HOME>/epistemic-graph/graph_snapshots`, hostPath on
   <ENGINE_NODE>) to a scratch path. Run the new pod spec's engine sidecar command **standalone**
   (a throwaway pod, `--persist-dir` pointed at the COPY, same TLS/signer/auth env)
   against the copy first. Confirm: catalog loads, graph count matches the live store,
   `EPISTEMIC_GRAPH_REQUIRE_OIDC=false` + the shared HMAC secret authenticate a test
   request.
2. **Import-test inside the running pod without restarting it** — not applicable here
   the same way (this is a topology change, not a code drop), but the equivalent is:
   deploy the new pod spec to a **scratch Deployment name** (e.g. `graph-os-selfhost-rehearsal`)
   pointed at the COPY from step 1, verify it reaches `Ready`, THEN do the real cutover
   against production. This costs one extra pod but converts an irreversible-feeling
   cutover into a rehearsed one.
3. Confirm the kvcache item above.
4. Confirm nothing besides `graph-os` currently dials the `epistemic-graph` Service
   directly (§"redb single-writer-lock handoff" already established `graph-os-host` and
   `agent-utilities-messaging` are both scaled to `0/0` fleet-wide — `kubectl get deploy
   --all-namespaces` — i.e. graph-os is already the sole live consumer; messaging/
   host-daemon are bundled INTO the unified graph-os image per
   `reports/unified-binary-program.md`'s status ledger, not separate processes anymore).
   Re-verify this is still true immediately before cutover, since it is the basis for
   binding the sidecar's TCP listener to loopback-only in the spec below.

## The pod spec

Both containers reference the **same** unified image
(`<REGISTRY>/graph-os-unified:<tag>` — the validated `latest`/`w-c-validation`, not a
`:langfuse`-style follow-up validation tag unless that work has separately been promoted).
As of D-IMG-2/D-CDX-18/D-EIMG-5 (2026-08-02), that tag is produced by the
`homelab/containers/images/graph-os-unified` GitLab CI pipeline (see `docker/README.md`
§5), not a hand-applied Kaniko Job. Deltas from today's live `graph-os` Deployment are
called out inline; everything not mentioned (au-config/au-src/eg-wheel mounts,
`graph-os-env`/`graph-os-secrets`, probes, resources, the existing `graph-os`
Service/Ingress) is **unchanged**.

target only the `graph-os` container's port 8000, which is unaffected by this cutover.
Delete (or scale to 0) the `epistemic-graph` Deployment and Service once the new pod is
verified — see the checklist.

## Rollback

The redb single-writer lock makes rollback a mirror of cutover, not a special case:

1. Scale the new `graph-os` (pod with the sidecar) to 0 — releases the lock.
2. Scale the OLD `epistemic-graph` Deployment back to 1 (this is why cutover step 3
   scales to 0 rather than deleting — keep it, its ConfigMap/Secret refs, and its
   Service around for the whole verification window before deleting anything).
3. `kubectl rollout undo deployment/graph-os -n platform` (or reapply the pre-cutover
   manifest) to restore the old pod spec (`GRAPH_SERVICE_ENDPOINTS=tls://<ENGINE_NODE_IP>:9100`
   via the durable config, no sidecar).
4. Confirm `graph-os` reaches `Ready` against the restored separate engine before
   declaring rollback complete.

Total rollback window is the same ballpark as cutover step 4 (one redb reload) — there
is no faster path given the single-writer lock; this is inherent to redb, not a gap in
this design.

## Validation checklist

- [ ] Pre-flight steps 1-4 all passed (copy-based rehearsal, kvcache confirmed,
      sole-consumer confirmed).
- [ ] New pod: `kubectl get pod -n platform -l app=graph-os` shows the sidecar
      `engine` container `Ready` before the `graph-os` container even starts
      (confirm via `kubectl describe pod` event ordering — this is the native-sidecar
      contract, not just a hopeful timing).
- [ ] `graph-os`'s `/health` (and `/health/ready`) report the engine reachable, mode
      consistent with `unix://` (not `tls://`/`remote-network`).
- [ ] Graph count in the catalog matches the pre-cutover count noted in pre-flight step 1
      (85-87 graphs per the most recent recorded count — confirm the CURRENT count
      immediately before cutover, don't reuse a stale figure).
- [ ] A representative KG query (e.g. `graph_query`/`graph_search` against `__commons__`
      or a known `code_*` graph) returns the same answer it did before cutover.
- [ ] The kvcache verify-before-cutover item resolved one way or the other, and the
      resolution reflected in the sidecar's final `args`.
- [ ] `platform/epistemic-graph` scaled to 0, not deleted, until this checklist is fully
      green AND a rollback rehearsal (§Rollback) has been dry-run at least once.
- [ ] Only after a soak period: delete the old `epistemic-graph` Deployment + Service,
      and the now-unused `ENGINE_CA_BUNDLE`/`ENGINE_TLS_SERVER_NAME` keys from
      `graph-os-env` (left in place until then, per the inline comment above).

## History: the horizontal-scaling shape this cutover replaced

Before this cutover, `graph-os` briefly ran as **Shape 2**
(`out-of-process-shared`: a separate, horizontally-scaled `epistemic-graph`
Deployment behind N independent `graph-os` client pods, scaled with a k8s
`HorizontalPodAutoscaler`). That shape was captured 2026-07-25 and
superseded the very next day by this document's Shape 1
(`unified-in-process`, `replicas: 1`, `strategy: Recreate`) — a deliberate
trade of horizontal scalability for a much simpler single-writer-lock
model.

Shape 2 is not the deployed topology and this page does not describe it
further, but if it is ever re-adopted for true zero-downtime rolling
updates, three blockers were identified against it (none is "add a TLS
profile" — engine↔client TLS itself was already live):

1. **A host-local config mount** — `graph-os`'s `nodeSelector` pinned it to
   the engine's node because of plain `hostPath` volumes, not
   `hostNetwork`; mechanical to fix (~an hour of work).
2. **A static-IP TLS identity pin, not a routable/discoverable one** —
   `ENGINE_TLS_SERVER_NAME` was the engine's literal node IP rather than a
   Service-routable name; a correctness gap, not urgent on its own.
3. **No shared MCP session store** — an accepted, documented limitation
   with a partial mitigation already live (`nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/
   affinity: cookie`), not something a future HPA program needs to solve
   before it can ship.

The full analysis (the live-fact table, the unblock sequence, and the
validation checklist) is preserved in agent-utilities' git history
(`docs/architecture/graphos-horizontal-scaling.md` as of its last edit),
not carried forward as a standalone page here.
