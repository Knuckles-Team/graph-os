"""Persistence-independent repository seams for connector control state.

The protocol deliberately separates operator desired state from append-only
probe observations.  An engine/SQL/KG adapter can implement this interface,
but this domain module does not select or import a database.  Implementations
must apply tenant, principal and grant scope before filtering, ordering,
pagination or counting.
