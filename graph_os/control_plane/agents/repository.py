"""Persistence-independent repository seams for the agent control plane.

The implementation may be backed by the authoritative knowledge engine, an
approved relational read model, or another repository owned outside this
domain.  This package deliberately does not select storage or dispatch an
agent.  Implementations must keep release pointers CAS-atomic and enforce
scope before filtering or pagination.
