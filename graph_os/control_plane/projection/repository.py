"""Persistence and GraphOS adapter seams for control-plane projection.

The interfaces in this module are deliberately small.  A relational adapter
implements one atomic authority-plus-outbox call; it must not expose a second
write path.  A GraphOS adapter receives only an :class:`OutboxEnvelope` and a
fencing term.  Checkpoint advancement is a separate compare-and-set operation,
so a failed projection never changes relational authority and a lost lease
cannot move a cursor.
