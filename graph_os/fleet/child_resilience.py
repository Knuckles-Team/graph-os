"""Per-child resilience runtime for the MCP multiplexer.

CONCEPT:AU-ECO.mcp.profile-differences-from-client — Fleet-Scale MCP Multiplexer Hardening.

The multiplexer aggregates ~50 child MCP servers behind one endpoint. Before
this module, every child was a single shared ``ClientSession`` with no
concurrency control: one slow or wedged child head-of-line blocked every
caller, and a crashed child hard-failed all of its tools until the whole
multiplexer was restarted.

:class:`ChildRuntime` wraps each child with the per-server hardening layer:

* **Bounded concurrency** — an ``asyncio.Semaphore`` caps in-flight calls per
  child (``MCP_CHILD_MAX_CONCURRENCY``, per-server ``max_concurrency``
  override in the server's AgentComponent configuration). Excess calls queue for at most
  ``MCP_CHILD_QUEUE_TIMEOUT`` seconds, then fail with the typed
  :class:`MCPChildBusyError` instead of hanging.
* **Session pools** — remote children may hold N round-robin connections
  (``MCP_CHILD_POOL_SIZE`` / per-server ``pool_size``); stdio children are
  single-pipe and keep exactly one session.
* **Cancellation-safe dispatch** — the child-side call runs in its own
  shielded task; a caller timeout/cancel detaches cleanly without corrupting
  the shared session's request/response bookkeeping.
* **Restart-on-crash** — each connection generation is owned by a supervisor
  task; transport failures tear the generation down and reconnect with
  exponential backoff (cap + jitter). More than ``MCP_CHILD_MAX_RESTARTS``
  restarts inside ``MCP_CHILD_RESTART_WINDOW`` parks the child as ``failed``.
  Calls to a restarting child wait briefly for recovery, then fail with the
  typed :class:`MCPChildUnavailableError` naming the child and its state.
* **Circuit breaker** — consecutive transport failures/timeouts open a
  per-child breaker (``MCP_CHILD_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`` /
  ``MCP_CHILD_BREAKER_COOLDOWN``), short-circuiting calls with the typed
  :class:`MCPChildCircuitOpenError` until a half-open probe succeeds. The
  GraphOS-owned per-child state machine with a per-child state gauge.

Crash detection is call-path driven: a stdio process exit or HTTP transport
failure surfaces as a stream/connection error on the next forwarded call,
which triggers the restart cycle (no idle polling of ~50 children).

Metrics land on the OS-5.23 registry (``observability.gateway_metrics``) and
degrade to no-ops when ``prometheus_client`` (the optional ``metrics`` extra)
is absent — the multiplexer runs standalone, so this stays import-light:
``agent_utilities_mcp_child_calls_total{server,outcome}``,
``..._mcp_child_breaker_state{server}``, ``..._mcp_child_restarts_total{server}``,
``..._mcp_child_queue_depth{server}``.

Tenant note: all callers still share each child's credentials (the child
process owns ONE identity). Per-caller credential injection is a deployment
follow-up, not handled here.
