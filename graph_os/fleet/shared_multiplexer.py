"""Process binding for the one multiplexer actually served by GraphOS.

CONCEPT:AU-ECO.multiplexer.tool-gateway-catalog

``attach_fleet_loader`` builds a fresh :class:`MCPMultiplexer` for a directly
served graph-os MCP process (``mcp_server()`` in ``kg_server.py``) — that
process owns the FastMCP serving loop the multiplexer's live-forwarder
bookkeeping is normally wired against. Two OTHER consumers need the SAME
dispatchable-truth catalog with no serving loop of their own:

* the REST twin of ``list_catalog``/``multiplexer_status``
  (:mod:`agent_utilities.server.routers.mcp_catalog`, GOC-60-W03), and
* the WebUI's governed MCP delegation seam's ``list_mcp_server_tools`` helper
  (:mod:`agent_utilities.server.webui_mcp_delegation`, GOC-60-W04b), and the
  WebUI's own MCP-servers inventory panel
  (``agent_webui.api_extensions.list_all_tools``), consuming this in-process
  rather than over HTTP.

REST and WebUI are adapters over the served catalog authority. They must not
construct a detached multiplexer with an independent cache, generation, child
pool, or writer. Composition binds the served instance once; consumers fail
closed until that binding exists.
