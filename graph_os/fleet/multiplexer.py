"""Multi-MCP Server Multiplexer.

Aggregates multiple underlying MCP servers (declared in an ``mcp_config.json``)
into a single unified server, delegating tool calls dynamically based on
prefixed tool names. This speeds up boot times and avoids per-server process
resource contention for clients with tool-count limits.

Composed by the native GraphOS MCP server: it uses
``create_mcp_server()`` for the standard ``--transport/--host/--port`` args and
middleware, and exposes the aggregated tools through a FastMCP instance so the
multiplexer can be deployed as either a **stdio** or **streamable-http** server.
The proven child-server lifecycle, algorithmic collision-free prefixing, and
enable/disable tool filtering are preserved (see :class:`MCPMultiplexer`).

# module scope on an SDK v2 image — and this module is the fleet loader, so that
# takes every child server down with it. `mcp_types_module()` binds whichever the
# installed SDK ships. (2) `mcp` is also a common PARAMETER name in this file (see

# attribute chain there resolves against the parameter, not the SDK.

    """Resolve ``host``'s local provider and a shape-checked snapshot of its
    private component registry (D-CDX-51).

    FastMCP 4.0.0b1's ``LocalProvider`` keeps executable tools in a plain
    private ``_components: dict[str, FastMCPComponent]`` and exposes no
    public atomic replace/remove API — so the atomic schema
    replace/rollback in :meth:`MCPMultiplexer._replace_exposed_forwarders`
    (and the KeyError-invariant check in
    :meth:`MCPMultiplexer._remove_host_forwarder`) have no choice but to
    snapshot and swap that private map directly. This project explicitly
    permits future FastMCP versions, and the fleet is ALREADY
    deliberately mixed-version (children on fastmcp 3.x; this canonical
    tree on fastmcp >=4.0.0b1) — so a later provider adding secondary
    indexes, lifecycle hooks, ownership metadata, or swapping the container
    type entirely is not hypothetical.

    This is the ONE place that reads ``_components``, and it validates the
    EXACT shape every caller depends on — a plain ``dict`` keyed by ``str``,
    whose values each expose both ``.key`` (used to re-key a staged
    forwarder in a swap) and ``.name`` (used by the KeyError-invariant
    check) — BEFORE returning anything, so an unrecognized layout is caught
    HERE, before any mutation, rather than silently corrupting host state
    two calls later. Raises :class:`UnsupportedLocalProviderLayout`
    (fail closed) the moment the shape does not hold.

    Returns ``(provider, snapshot)`` where ``snapshot`` is a fresh ``dict``
    copy — safe for a caller to mutate or roll back to without touching the
    live registry until it explicitly swaps.

# A catalog entry opts into per-user delegated authorization by declaring an
# admin-configured ``oauth_provider`` block (the exact shape
# ``agent_utilities.mcp.remote_oauth_broker.ProviderDescriptor`` accepts) on
# its config -- the SAME "administrator-populated, never caller-supplied"
# catalog these config dicts already are (headers/env/tls_profile/
# allowed_private_hosts all come from here today). Such a server is
# structurally excluded from the fleet-global, principal-agnostic pool
# (``_start_child`` skips it, see below) and from the shared probe-result
# cache (``_probe_cache_hit``/``_cache_probe``, see below) -- it is served
# EXCLUSIVELY through ephemeral, per-request sessions
# (``_open_one_session``, already used this way by ``probe_server`` for any
# un-pooled server), each one bound to the CURRENT caller's own delegated
# grant. This deliberately reuses the broker's own reserved seam
# (``bearer_headers_for``) and this repo's existing verified-actor primitive
# (``brain_context.current_actor``) rather than any of the specific outbound
# delegated-identity primitive names the U-44/U-45 canary in
# ``tests/unit/mcp/test_remote_oauth_fail_closed.py`` fences (see that test's
# own module docstring for the list) -- those would mean a per-user token
# reached the ONE shared session-per-server pool every other caller also
# uses, which this wiring never does.

        Idempotent: if the child is already mounted, its already-registered
        prefixed tools are returned without re-spawning. Returns ``[]`` for an
        unknown/unconfigured server. Loop-safe because it is invoked from
        inside the serving event loop (either at boot or from a tool call), so
        the child ``ClientSession`` objects bind to the running loop.

        D-CDX-44: per-server singleflight. Multiple concurrent callers can
        legitimately request the SAME unmounted ``server_name`` at once (two
        sessions calling ``load_tools`` back to back, two sessions racing the
        ``ensure_always_loaded`` eager pass, ...). Without ownership, each
        would independently observe ``server_name not in self.children`` and
        each would start its own child runtime — duplicate provider
        processes/connections, a registration race on the shared aggregation
        maps, and doubled probe/startup cost. Exactly ONE task (the leader)
        runs :meth:`_mount_child_first_load`; every concurrent caller for the
        same ``server_name`` (a follower) awaits the SAME shared future and
        observes the leader's exact outcome instead of starting its own
        attempt. Different servers mount fully in parallel — the singleflight

        **not** bound how long an individual probe is allowed to run — that
        is each server's own ``probe_timeout``/``timeout``, honored
        independently by :meth:`probe_server`. A server still probing when
        the budget expires is NEVER cancelled: cancelling it would also
        cancel its own ``self._probe_cache`` write, which is exactly what
        used to make an unreachable server pay its full connect cost again
        on every subsequent call, forever, instead of the cache the tool's
        own contract promises ("the first call probes the fleet; later
        calls are cached"). It keeps running toward its own deadline in the
        background — ``_probe_inflight`` lets a later call join that SAME
        probe instead of duplicating it — and each pending server gets an
        honest, individual answer here: a prior (possibly ``stale``,
        age-labelled) result if one exists, or an explicit ``pending``
        marker on its first-ever attempt. Reachable servers are never
        blocked by an unreachable one (CONCEPT:AU-ECO.multiplexer.tool-gateway-catalog).

        A long-lived multiplexer (graph-os's fleet loader) relies on
        :meth:`aclose` to cancel whatever is still in-flight at real
        shutdown. A short-lived caller wrapped in ``asyncio.run(...)``
        (e.g. ``source_sync._sync_fleet`` via ``_run_async``) gets the same
        guarantee for free — ``asyncio.run`` cancels every task still on its
        loop when the coroutine it ran returns, this multiplexer's included
        — so no caller needs to await these background probes itself.

        ``priority`` tags this call's probe tasks with a
        :class:`_resource_priority.PriorityClass` (ORCH-1.98) for their whole background
        lifetime — pass ``_resource_priority.PriorityClass.BACKGROUND_INGESTION`` for a broad
        catalog sweep so it yields shared-resource contention to
        interactive/orchestration work; leave unset to inherit the
        caller's ambient priority (the default — appropriate for a small,
        caller-named set of servers on the interactive path).

        ``servers`` narrows a latency-sensitive first stage without
        creating a second probe path.

        A cached entry aged past ``mcp_catalog_probe_ttl`` is targeted for
        re-probe exactly like an uncached one
        (CONCEPT:AU-ECO.multiplexer.catalog-probe-ttl-staleness) — the fleet
        cache never goes stale forever. The re-probe runs through the same
        ``_ensure_probing``/budget machinery as any other target, so it
        NEVER blocks this call past its own ``budget``: a caller that hits
        the deadline before the refresh lands still gets the last-known
        answer, honestly labelled ``stale`` with its real ``age_s``, while

    (verified empirically — not merely a docstring claim). That is why
    :func:`_session_key`'s non-HTTP branch cannot derive an ambient per-connection
    key the way the HTTP branch does.

    Multiple logically-distinct local callers sharing ONE process (e.g. an

    the SAME in-process multiplexer/FastMCP instance) therefore used to
    collapse onto the single ``"__local_stdio__"`` bucket and see each other's

    The fix is a caller-supplied session id carried in the standard MCP
    request ``_meta`` (``Client.call_tool(..., meta={...})`` is a first-class,
    documented FastMCP mechanism for exactly this kind of contextual data —
    unlike ``Context.session_id`` it is NOT reconstructed per request, it is

    consulted from the non-HTTP branch of :func:`_session_key`: a real HTTP
    session's key is derived from the AUTHENTICATED connection/token, and must
    never be overridable by caller-declared request metadata (that would let
    one HTTP caller simply claim another's session id). Within a single
    trusted process, callers are not adversarial to each other in this way —
    this only ever adds isolation between COOPERATING local callers, it can

    graph-os serves its own KG/engine tools natively (always on). This composes the
    fleet-aggregation engine on top so the SAME server can also reach the rest of the
    MCP fleet on demand — a serving composition supplies the EG catalog reader,
    while standalone callers may retain the legacy ``mcp_config.json`` source. It
    registers the meta-tools ``find_tools`` / ``list_catalog`` / ``load_tools`` /
    ``catalog_refresh`` / ``catalog_dispatch`` / ``catalog_session_resume`` /
    ``multiplexer_status`` plus a per-session
    progressive-disclosure middleware. Child
    servers are mounted LAZILY (each as an isolated subprocess/HTTP session via
    :class:`~graph_os.fleet.child_resilience.ChildRuntime`, with its own breaker +
    concurrency limit) only when a tool is actually loaded, so the base context stays
    small. Returns the :class:`MCPMultiplexer` for lifecycle — call ``await mux.aclose()``
    on shutdown. (CONCEPT:AU-ECO.multiplexer.tool-gateway-catalog)

    All wiring here is synchronous (catalog-state initialization + tool registration
    + middleware); no child is spawned at attach time, so it drops cleanly into
    graph-os's synchronous ``mcp.run(...)`` startup with no event loop.

    ``embed_fn(texts: list[str]) -> list[vector]`` (optional) makes ``find_tools``
    SEMANTIC: graph-os injects its own in-process embedding model so tool suggestions
    rank by query↔description meaning (understands intent) instead of only literal token
    overlap. Per-tool embeddings are cached; it runs off-thread. When absent, discovery
    falls back to the embedding-free token-overlap backbone (never a hard dependency).

    ``authority_scope`` is the host's trusted context manager for stdio process
    authority. GraphOS supplies its existing verified-tool scope; network calls
    keep their request-minted ambient session. The callback is never derived
    from child configuration or caller arguments.

    ``catalog_reader`` is the graph-os/epistemic-graph read port. When present,
    the returned multiplexer starts empty and the composition root must await
    ``refresh_engine_catalog()`` before starting children; it never reads the
    legacy static ``mcp_config.json`` as a fallback. Without a reader, the
    standalone/unit-test constructor retains its static-file behavior.
