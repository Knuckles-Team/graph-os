"""Serve agent-webui inside the graph-os process as a supervised co-service.

CONCEPT:AU-OS.deployment.webui-co-service — agent-webui as a graph-os co-service

Why this exists
---------------
Every piece of this was already built and only the last wire was missing:

* ``agent-utilities[ag-ui]`` already declares ``agent-webui`` as an optional
  dependency, so the package is installable alongside graph-os with no new
  distribution work.
* the gateway routers the dashboard fronts (``agent_utilities.gateway.*``) are
  already served from this process — agent-webui is the frontend facade over
  them, which is why serving it here duplicates nothing.
* ``ENABLE_WEB_UI`` is already real config, and
  :func:`agent_utilities.mcp.co_service_supervisor.detect_composition` already
  reports it as part of the composition plan.

What was missing is the branch that actually starts it. That branch previously
declined on the premise that agent-webui is "a separate Node/Vite frontend,
not a Python asyncio task". That premise is stale: agent-webui ships a FastAPI
application factory and *serves* its built Vite bundle as SPA static files, so
it runs in-process like any other ASGI app.

The identity consequence is the point
-------------------------------------
A co-service runs on ``_authorized_background_thread``, inheriting the graph-os
process's verified actor and ``GraphSession`` for its whole lifetime. graph-os
is the principal the engine's signer registry already trusts, so a WebUI
request handled here can sign engine admission **as itself**
(:func:`agent_utilities.security.admission_authority.resolve_admission_authority`)
— which is the only pairing the engine accepts
(``verify_register_identity_signature`` requires ``signer == principal``). Run
as a separate deployment, agent-webui holds no signer entry at all, which is
why tenant admission failed for every sign-in.
