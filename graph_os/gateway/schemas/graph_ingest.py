"""Pydantic request/response models for the ``/api/graph/ingest/*`` and
``/api/graph/write/*`` REST route families.

CONTEXT (why this module exists): every route in this family is mounted by
the configured graph-os application port as a raw Starlette
``app.add_route(...)`` handler, so today the live OpenAPI 3.1.0 spec documents
**zero** of these paths — FastAPI only introspects routes registered via
``add_api_route(..., response_model=...)``. These models are the typed
contract a later lane wires onto those routes with
``add_api_route(response_model=...)`` so the spec finally documents them.
Nothing here changes runtime behavior; it only describes the wire contract
each handler already enforces.

DERIVATION METHOD: for every route, the handler function in ``kg_server.py``
was read line-by-line to see exactly which JSON keys it pulls out of
``request.json()`` (or the raw request for GET/DELETE) and which keyword
arguments it forwards to ``_execute_tool(<tool_name>, **kwargs)``. Two shapes
occur:

* **Full passthrough** (``/graph/write``, ``/graph/ingest`` — the base,
  action-routed endpoints): the handler forwards the ENTIRE parsed body as
  ``_execute_tool(tool_name, **body)``. The real contract is therefore the
  underlying tool's own signature (``graph_write``/``graph_ingest`` in
  ``agent_utilities/mcp/tools/write_ingest_tools.py``), which is what these
  models mirror field-for-field. ``_execute_tool`` itself validates the
  forwarded kwargs against that signature and raises
  ``UnsupportedToolFieldError`` (mapped to HTTP 400) for anything the tool
  does not declare — so a field the model doesn't know about is NOT silently
  dropped by the server, only by an overly-strict client-side schema. To
  avoid a schema-vs-server strictness mismatch, these two models use
  ``extra="allow"``: unknown fields survive validation and are forwarded
  exactly as the handler already forwards them, and the *server* remains the
  single source of truth on which fields a given ``action`` actually accepts.

* **Cherry-picked / single-action** (every granular ``/graph/write/{node,
  edge,bulk,chat,execution}`` and ``/graph/ingest/{submit,corpus,observe,
  agent-toolkit,materialize,reflect,sync}`` route): the handler hard-codes
  the ``action`` and reads only a fixed, small set of keys off the body via
  ``body.get(...)``, ignoring everything else — proven by inspection, not
  assumed. These models therefore use the pydantic default (``extra``
  unset, i.e. ignored) rather than ``allow``: preserving an unread field
  would misrepresent the request as having been forwarded when the handler
  demonstrably never looks at it.

KNOWN LIVE DEFECT ENCODED CORRECTLY (not replicated): ``graph_write_node_endpoint``/
``graph_write_delete_node_endpoint`` previously called ``_execute_tool("graph_write",
id=...)`` while the tool declares the parameter ``node_id`` — every call failed
closed with ``UnsupportedToolFieldError``. The handler was already fixed to pass
``node_id=`` before this module was written; ``GraphWriteNodeRequest`` below
names the field ``node_id`` (never ``id``), and
``tests/unit/gateway/test_schemas_graph_ingest.py`` pins the correct name so a
regression trips a test, not just a runtime 400.

OTHER WIRE-NAME MISMATCHES FOUND (same class of bug-shape, but currently
INTENTIONAL renamings rather than defects — see the field docstrings below for
each):

* ``POST /graph/write/chat`` accepts wire field ``content``, which
  ``graph_write_chat_endpoint`` maps onto the tool's ``properties`` parameter
  (``properties=body.get("content", "")``). Modeled as ``content`` (the wire
  name a caller actually uses), with a note on the underlying mapping.
* ``POST /graph/ingest/agent-toolkit`` accepts wire fields ``sources`` and
  ``agent_card_path``, which ``graph_ingest_agent_toolkit_endpoint`` maps onto
  the tool's ``target_path`` and ``description`` parameters respectively.
  Modeled as ``sources``/``agent_card_path`` (the wire names), with a note on
  the underlying mapping.

FIXED, NOT A LIVE GAP (history, so the same shape doesn't get "discovered"
again): the granular ``graph_write_bulk_endpoint`` (``POST
/graph/write/bulk``) used to forward only ``nodes`` to
``graph_write(action="bulk_ingest", ...)``, silently discarding
``idempotency_key``/``evidence``/``upsert``/``connection``/``graph`` and
always taking the non-idempotent ``BatchUpdate`` (light) path with
``upsert=True``. That route no longer exists: ``kg_server.py``'s six-way
granular-route consolidation (see its ``GraphWriteAction`` union) deleted
``graph_write_bulk_endpoint`` and replaced it with ``POST /graph/write``,
``action='bulk_ingest'`` (``_BulkIngestAction``, which extends
``GraphWriteBulkRequest`` below and forwards every field). Callers use that
route today; ``GraphWriteBulkRequest`` now exists only as
``_BulkIngestAction``'s base class, not as a route model in its own right.

TWO ROUTES IN SCOPE HAVE NO REQUEST MODEL BY DESIGN: ``GET /graph/ingest/jobs``
(``graph_ingest_jobs_endpoint``) and ``GET /graph/ingest/job/{job_id}``
(``graph_ingest_job_status_endpoint``) are both GET with no JSON body — the
latter's only input is the ``job_id`` path parameter, already typed by the
route pattern itself. Both return ``GraphToolResponse`` on success; no
dedicated request model is defined for either.

RESPONSE SHAPE: every route in both families returns the SAME envelope on
success — ``{"status": "success", "result": safe_json_load(res)}`` — built
in ``kg_server.py`` right after each ``_execute_tool(...)`` call.
``safe_json_load`` JSON-decodes ``res`` when it is a JSON-parseable string and
returns it unchanged otherwise (most of these tools return a human-readable
plain string, e.g. ``"Node n1 added."``; several return a JSON-encoded
object, e.g. bulk_ingest's chunk-count summary). Because ``result``'s actual
shape varies per route AND per the tool's internal branch (e.g. bulk_ingest's
``noop``/``change_envelope``/``batch_update`` modes each add different keys),
it is modeled permissively as ``Any`` on one SHARED ``GraphToolResponse`` —
the stable part is the envelope, not the payload inside it. A stricter
per-route response type is deliberately NOT invented here; see
``GraphToolResponse``'s own docstring.
