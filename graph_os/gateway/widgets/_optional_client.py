"""Shared guarded-import helper for connector widgets.

CONCEPT:AU-OS.config.gateway-service-dashboard — Gateway Service Dashboard

Every widget that talks to a sibling ``agent-packages/agents/*`` connector
package must guard that import: the aggregator refreshes every ~10 seconds,
and an uninstalled sibling package must degrade to a ``skipped``
:class:`~graph_os.gateway.models.WidgetData` instead of raising
``ModuleNotFoundError`` on every cycle (mirrors the pre-existing ``ear``
widget's pattern). This one helper replaces the identical
try/import/except-ImportError block that would otherwise be copy-pasted into
every connector widget.
