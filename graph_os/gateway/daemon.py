"""Gateway-hosted unified KG daemon (CONCEPT:EG-KG.storage.nonblocking-checkpoint /
OS-5.9).

The API gateway is the single process that runs the ONE consolidated KG
background daemon (queue drain + graph writer + task workers + maintenance
scheduler + file-watch poll). Every other entry point — the MCP server, CLI,
and one-shot scripts — runs as a ``client`` (``KG_DAEMON_ROLE=client``) and
spawns NO background threads; their work is enqueued to the durable task queue
that this host daemon drains.

Mount the daemon with ``start_host_daemon()`` from the gateway's lifespan/startup
and surface its state via the ``/daemon/*`` routes on ``dashboard_router``.

    """Expose this daemon's ``agent_utilities_*`` Prometheus registry over HTTP.

    CONCEPT:AU-OS.observability.daemon-metrics-listener (D-OG-4). The
    consolidated KG host daemon this module runs records the
    ``SCHEDULED_JOB_*``/``LANE_*``/``KG_INGEST_*``/``DISPATCH_*`` families
    (``observability/gateway_metrics.py``) into the SAME per-process
    ``prometheus_client`` registry every other metric in this package uses —
    but unlike graph-os (``server_factory.py``, port 8000) or the full
    gateway (``gateway/graph_api.py``), the standalone entry point this
    module's :func:`main` runs (``python3 -m graph_os.gateway.daemon``
    — the ``graph-os-host`` container in the live pod) has NO HTTP server of
    any kind. Half of the package's defined metric series were therefore
    structurally uncollectable: recorded, but never scrapeable.
    ``prometheus_client.start_http_server`` is deliberately the entire fix —
    it starts a small background HTTP thread serving ``generate_latest()``
    over the default registry; no new route table, no framework.

    Only called from the standalone :func:`main` path, never from
    :func:`start_host_daemon` directly — when this daemon instead runs
    in-process inside the full gateway (mounted from its lifespan, per this
    module's own docstring), that process already serves ``GET /metrics``
    on its own HTTP port via ``graph_api.py``, reading the identical shared
    registry; a second listener there would be redundant, not merely
    harmless.

    Bind address / auth — read the justification, this is a deliberate
    judgment call, not a default:

    Binds **pod-local** (``0.0.0.0`` inside the container; default port
    ``9110``, ``KG_DAEMON_METRICS_PORT``) with **no bearer token** — unlike
    graph-os's own ``/metrics`` (``server_factory.py``), which IS
    bearer-gated on a non-loopback listener. That is not an inconsistency;
    it is the same exposure judgment reaching the opposite answer because
    the exposure itself differs:

    * graph-os's ``/metrics`` (port 8000) lives on the SAME listener as the
      public/Ingress-facing MCP tool-call surface (``graph-os.example``) — an
      unauthenticated route there is reachable by anyone who can reach that
      hostname, hence the bearer gate.
    * This listener has no Service port and no Ingress route. Its only
      intended consumer is Prometheus's ``kubernetes-pods-metrics-port`` job
      (``role: pod``, zero-annotation discovery keyed on a container port
      literally named ``metrics``), which itself only runs inside the
      cluster's pod network — the same reachability tier as
      node-exporter/cAdvisor, both already scraped unauthenticated
      fleet-wide (see docs/architecture/observability.md's topology table).
      This is that tier, not a broader one.
    * The content is pure operational counts/durations/labels (schedule
      names, lane names, queue depths) — never a secret, a tool-call
      payload, or PII.
    * A strictly loopback (``127.0.0.1``) bind — the posture the bundled
      ``epistemic-graph-server`` engine itself uses for its own native
      metrics listener — would be UNREACHABLE from Prometheus, which scrapes
      via the Pod IP (the shared pod network's routable interface), not via
      a process that merely shares the pod's network namespace. Pod-local
      is the narrowest bind Prometheus's pod-IP scrape model can reach.

    Never blocks daemon startup. Two distinct failure modes are both logged
    at ERROR — loud, never swallowed — and both leave the daemon running
    with no metrics listener, exactly as it behaved before this function
    existed:

    * the optional ``metrics`` extra (``prometheus-client``) is not
      installed;
    * the bind itself fails (port already in use, permission denied, ...).
