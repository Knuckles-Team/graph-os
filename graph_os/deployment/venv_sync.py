"""Sanctioned reconciler for the shared uv-workspace virtualenv.

CONCEPT:AU-OS.deployment.workspace-venv-reconciler
CONCEPT:AU-OS.safety.destructive-sync-refusal
CONCEPT:AU-OS.host.venv-drift-detector

Why this module exists
----------------------
The ecosystem is developed against ONE shared ``.venv`` at the uv-workspace
root, with ~75 workspace members installed editable into it and ~26 git
worktrees running their tests through it.  Two properties of that arrangement
are actively dangerous and both were paid for in production time:

1. **A bare ``uv sync`` destroys the environment.**  The workspace root project
   declares zero dependencies, so its target set is empty and ``uv sync``
   prunes everything that is not in it — a measured *557* uninstalls including
   every editable member.  The only correct invocation is
   ``uv sync --locked --all-packages --inexact``.  Neither ``--all-packages``
   nor ``--inexact`` has a ``UV_*`` environment equivalent, so the safe form
   cannot be made the shell default; it has to be made the *only* form any
   sanctioned path can construct.  :class:`SyncInvocation` therefore has no
   field that can drop a mandatory flag, and :func:`_assert_sanctioned` re-checks
   the argv immediately before ``subprocess`` sees it, so a future refactor that
   assembles an argv somewhere else still cannot get a destructive one past this
   module.
2. **Drift is silent.**  The venv sat ten days behind its own lock
   (``fastmcp`` 3.4.4 / ``mcp`` 1.28.1 against a lock wanting 4.0.0b1 / 2.0.0).
   An entire test module stopped collecting because one import failed, hiding
   thirteen real defects.  Nothing checked, so nobody knew.  :func:`detect_drift`
   is the check, and it is wired into ``agent-utilities doctor`` so it runs
   without anyone remembering to run it.

Design constraints this module honours
--------------------------------------
* **Stdlib only.**  This is the tool you reach for when the venv is broken, so
  it must not import anything the venv provides — including the rest of
  ``agent_utilities``.  Optional third-party helpers (``packaging``) are probed
  lazily and always have a stdlib fallback.
* **The workspace root is not a git repository.**  Discovery walks up looking
  for a ``pyproject.toml`` carrying ``[tool.uv.workspace]``; it never shells
  ``git rev-parse``, which is what made ``scripts/uv_workspace.py`` unusable
  from the root.
* **Another actor mutates the venv concurrently.**  Every mutation runs under an
  advisory exclusive lock and re-plans inside the lock, and every guardrail can
  answer ``defer`` rather than ``refuse`` so a busy environment is left alone
  instead of being fought over.
* **The lock has no version control.**  ``uv.lock`` is untracked and lives at a
  non-git root, so :class:`LockBackupStore` is the only rollback path there is;
  every mutation is wrapped in a checkpoint before it starts.
* **Abstraction first.**  Guardrails, activity probes and verify probes are
  registries of small protocols.  The default set encodes today's known hazards;
  adding a hazard means registering a probe, not editing a policy branch.

No new environment variables are introduced (configuration discipline): every
knob is a constructor/CLI argument, and the on/off state lives in one JSON
document under the XDG state directory.

      imports through the source tree.  Reinstalling would be pure cost.

      invalidates the resolution shared by every dependent, so it needs a
      relock followed by a sync; an entry-point or version change needs the

    * **native** — Rust/C sources need the extension rebuilt; an editable
      install does not track those.
    * **lock** — ``uv.lock`` itself moved, so the environment must be re-synced.

    The classification is the cheap *trigger-time* signal.  It is deliberately
