"""Functional (live) validation layer — a client of a reachable graph-os MCP.

This layer never starts graph-os, the engine, or any other service — it is
purely a client, exactly like `agent_utilities.skills.runtime_validation`
(the existing bundled-skill certification harness this pattern is modeled
on). Every network operation is wrapped in a short, explicit timeout so an
unreachable or hung endpoint degrades to ``SKIPPED-unreachable`` instead of
blocking the harness or reporting a false PASS.

What it actually exercises today: every skill whose body names a live
graph-os tool (a backtick ``graph_*``/``engine_*``/``ontology_*``/``object_*``
span) is checked against the MCP server's OWN advertised ``list_tools()``
result — catching the real-world failure mode of a skill documenting a tool
that was renamed or removed. A skill with no such references is not
graph-os-routed and is marked ``SKIPPED-not-applicable`` (not a failure).
