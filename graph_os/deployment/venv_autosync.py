"""Merge-triggered auto-flip for the shared uv-workspace virtualenv.

CONCEPT:AU-OS.deployment.merge-triggered-venv-flip

The operator's requirement: *"when we merge to main locally, we want a
development process that automatically flips that live (even for things with
many downstream relationships)"*.

Why git hooks, and why they only *enqueue*
------------------------------------------
Four mechanisms were available and only one observes the actual event:

* a **``post-merge`` git hook** fires exactly once, synchronously, at the moment
  a merge lands — zero polling, zero latency, and it knows the repository, the
  branch and (via ``ORIG_HEAD``) precisely which files moved.  Nothing else
  knows *what changed*, which is what decides whether any work is needed at all;
* a **filesystem watcher** would have to poll ~75 repositories, cannot
  distinguish a merge from an editor save, and adds a daemon to supervise;
* a **``make`` target** is not automatic — the failure mode being fixed here is
  precisely that nobody remembered to run the command;
* **CI** cannot help: the flip is local, and the workspace root is not even a
  git repository.

Hooks live in the repository's *common* git directory, so installing once in a
member checkout also covers every one of its linked worktrees — which is what
makes this tractable across ~26 concurrent worktrees.

The hook itself does almost nothing.  It writes an **intent record** and returns,
because the one thing this must never do is swap packages underneath a lane that
is mid-test.  A detached reconciler drains the queue under the same guardrails as
every other mutation, and a deferred intent stays queued (and is reported as
pending drift) rather than being dropped.

What actually needs to happen on a merge
----------------------------------------
Editable installs make most merges free:

* **source-only change** — already live for the member *and every downstream
  dependent*, because they all import through the source tree.  The reconciler
  records it and does nothing.
* **metadata change** (``pyproject.toml`` dependencies/scripts/version) — the
  installed ``.dist-info`` and, for a dependency change, the whole workspace
  resolution are now stale.  This is the case with the wide blast radius — and
  therefore the case the requirement actually named — so ``on_metadata_change``
  defaults to *relock*: back up, re-resolve, sync, verify, auto-roll-back.  That
  default is only defensible because of the guardrail stack it runs inside; see
  :class:`AutosyncConfig` for the full reasoning and for when to prefer the
  conservative *propose* mode instead.
* **native change** (Rust/C) — the compiled extension must be rebuilt; a sync
  does that.
* **``uv.lock`` moved** — sync.

    #: ``propose``  — record it loudly and leave the relock to an operator;
    #: ``sync-only``— sync against the existing lock and report the staleness.
    #:
    #: Why ``relock`` is the default, given that it re-resolves a lock shared by
    #: every worktree: the requirement this feature exists to satisfy is
    #: "merging to main flips that live **even for things with many downstream

    #: precisely that case.  ``propose`` stops exactly there, so it would honour
    #: the letter of "keep the venv current" while declining the one case that
    #: was actually asked for.
    #:
    #: What makes that safe rather than reckless is the guardrail stack this
    #: policy runs inside, and the default is only defensible *because* of it:
    #:
    #:   * :class:`~graph_os.deployment.venv_sync.ActivityGuardrail`
    #:     defers while any lane is mid-test, so a relock never lands underneath
    #:     running work;
    #:   * :class:`~graph_os.deployment.venv_sync.LockBackupStore`
    #:     archives ``uv.lock`` before the mutation starts;
    #:   * the verify probes run after it, and any failure **auto-rolls-back**
    #:     the lock and re-syncs the environment;
    #:   * a refusal outranks a deferral, so a plan that would net-remove a
    #:     workspace member is rejected regardless of timing.
    #:
    #: Remove any one of those and ``propose`` would be the right default.
    #:
    #: Prefer ``propose`` when the environment has many concurrent editors who
    #: must not have their resolution move under them, or while a large merge
    #: campaign is in flight — the relock would be correct but its timing would
    #: not be. It is a supported mode, not a deprecated one.
