"""Governed self-deploy — close the build loop's last mile.

The missing step after build→test→merge: make the merged change *live*. The served
daemon source-mounts the code but only picks it up on restart, and that restart is
the opaque, manual gap that breaks the loop every time. This provides:

* :func:`plan_redeploy` — the exact, safe answer to "how do I make my change live"
  (the restart command, the health endpoint, the rollback note) — used by the
  ``deploy`` context provider so the answer is one query.
* :func:`execute_redeploy` — the *governed* mutation: it passes through the
  fail-closed :class:`ActionPolicy` gate (``kind="restart_service"``), is **dry-run
  by default** (``confirm=False`` plans only), and on a real run health-checks after
  the restart and reports a rollback path. Credential/host access stays human-gated
  by design — this never force-restarts a shared daemon without explicit confirm AND
  a policy allow.
