"""Multi-backend deployment planner for the self-composing ``graph-os`` entrypoint.

``graph-os`` (the ``mcp_server()`` entrypoint + :mod:`agent_utilities.mcp.co_service_supervisor`)
already composes its served co-services (messaging and agent-webui discovery) IN
one process wherever it runs. The background KG host remains an explicit gateway
or ``graph-os-daemon`` role; a client-role GraphOS is never promoted. This module
answers the follow-on question —
*where* should that one process run: this process, a docker/podman container, a
Kubernetes pod, or a plain host process managed by systemd — using the SAME
composition detection (:func:`agent_utilities.mcp.co_service_supervisor.detect_composition`)
so every backend agrees on what co-services are configured.

**No new orchestrator client is built here.** Per this repo's "Sprawl boundaries —
extend before you add" rule, the fleet already has real docker/podman/Kubernetes
coverage (``container-manager-mcp``: ``cm_compose_operations``, the ``cm_k8s_*``
tool family), host/service management (``systems-manager``: ``sm_service_operations``,
``sm_file_operations``), and the canonical host inventory + SSH remote-exec
(``tunnel-manager``: ``tm_hosts``/``tm_remote``, reading
``~/.config/agent-utilities/inventory.yaml`` — see ``docs/examples/example_tunnel_inventory.yaml``).
Every backend below is a THIN adapter that renders a :class:`DeploymentPlan` — a
deterministic, reviewable, data-only description of what would be done — over
those existing tools. A plan's :class:`FleetToolCall` entries are never dispatched
by this module; the sanctioned way to actually run one is the same path every
other cross-service action in this codebase uses (``AGENTS.md`` → "Delegate to
the KG + graph-os"): ``graph_orchestrate action=execute_agent`` against the named
server (human-reviewed), or the fleet loader (``load_tools`` then a direct tool
call). This module's job stops at producing a correct plan.

Honesty over completeness (this project has been burned before by a "deployer"
that reported success without doing the work): the four backends are NOT equally
real.

* :class:`InProcessBackend` — REAL. ``apply(dry_run=False)`` genuinely starts the
  composed co-services in THIS process via the same
  :func:`agent_utilities.mcp.co_service_supervisor.start_co_services` the
  ``graph-os`` entrypoint itself calls. Fully unit-tested.
* :class:`NativeShellBackend` — REAL for the artifact it owns (a systemd unit
  file's content) — that generation is unit-tested. The install/start steps are
  PLAN-ONLY ``FleetToolCall``s against ``systems-manager``/``tunnel-manager``;
  this module never runs them (no live host access from here).
* :class:`ContainerBackend` (docker/podman) — PLAN-ONLY. Renders a real compose
  YAML (unit-tested) and the exact ``container-manager-mcp`` ``cm_compose_operations``
  call that would apply it; ``apply()`` always refuses to execute (raises), it
  never calls the fleet tool.
* :class:`KubernetesBackend` — PLAN-ONLY, and further limited: ``container-manager-mcp``
  exposes rich per-kind ``cm_k8s_*`` CRUD (StatefulSet/DaemonSet/Job/CronJob/
  ConfigMap/Secret/...) but **no generic manifest-apply or Deployment-create
  tool**. The plan therefore renders a manifest for the operator's existing
  GitOps path (Portainer / ``kubectl apply`` review) rather than claiming an
  executable step that does not exist. ``apply()`` always refuses.

READ-ONLY / no live mutation from this module, ever — ``apply()`` is a dry-run
planner for every backend except :class:`InProcessBackend` (which mutates only
the CALLING process's own composition, exactly like starting ``graph-os``
locally always has).
