"""Durable single-owner leases for messaging inbound intake.

Credentials make a backend usable for governed outbound sends; they do not, by
themselves, grant permission to open an inbound poller.  An embedded intake
owner must acquire the deterministic WorkItem for each ``(platform, bot)``
identity.  The engine-native claim/renew/reclaim verbs remain the only lease
authority, so another process can take over after an expired owner lease.
