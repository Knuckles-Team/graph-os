"""Durable inbound-message inbox + retry — nothing goes unanswered (CONCEPT:AU-ECO.messaging.durable-inbound-pending).

An inbound chat turn is recorded as a durable ``:InboundMessage`` node BEFORE the reply is
attempted, and marked ``answered`` only when a reply is actually delivered. A reaper in the
messaging daemon re-attempts still-pending messages (the engine was down, a transient error)
with bounded retries, so the "I saved your message" fallback becomes a real promise instead of
best-effort — a turn that fails mid-flight is found and answered when the system recovers.
