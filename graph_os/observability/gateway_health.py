"""Gateway self-telemetry → the shared health-intelligence kernels (GRAPHOS-HOST-R008).

CONCEPT:AU-OS.observability.unified-health-kernels (gateway producer) /
AU-KG.identity.evidence-spine-convergence (``MetricWindow`` locus).

Wires two previously-dead pieces off ONE real, already-computed signal — the
per-request latency the gateway's request middleware already measures for
its Prometheus histogram, then discards once it is handed to ``.observe()``:

1. ``agent_utilities.observability.health``'s anomaly-detection kernel
   (:func:`~agent_utilities.observability.health.compute_baseline` /
   :func:`~agent_utilities.observability.health.detect_anomaly`) plus
   :func:`~agent_utilities.observability.health_ingest.ingest_health_anomaly`
   had zero live callers anywhere in the agent runtime — a fully-built,
   generalized kernel with no producer wiring it. This module is that live
   caller.
2. ``MediaStore.store_metric_window_evidence`` (``eg_modality::EvidenceSpan::
   MetricWindow``) had no producer — an anomaly's own supporting trend window
   *is* the evidence for the claim "the gateway was anomalously slow here".

Bounded by design — NOT one evidence write per request. Request durations are
distilled into ONE trend row per ``_WINDOW_S`` window
(:class:`~agent_utilities.observability.health.HealthTrendBuffer`, the same
distill-don't-dump cadence every other health-kernel consumer uses), and a
KG write only fires when ``detect_anomaly`` actually flags that window
against the gateway's own rolling baseline — a rare, meaningful event, never
a per-request write. Entirely best-effort: any failure here must never
affect the request/response path it's decoupled from (fire-and-forget via
``asyncio.create_task``).

Ported from the agent runtime's
``agent_utilities.observability.gateway_health`` (moved wholesale, no
behavior change) per the GRAPHOS-HOST-R008 boundary move. The health
kernel and KG-ingest modules it calls (``agent_utilities.observability.health``
/ ``health_ingest``) and the KG memory store
(``agent_utilities.knowledge_graph.memory.native_ingest``) have not moved
yet; this module reaches back into the agent runtime for them, the normal
direction for an incremental migration (graph-os depends on the agent
runtime, never the reverse).
